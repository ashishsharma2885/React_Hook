useCallback - useCallback is a React Hook that you cache a function definition between re-renders.
it means, when we use the useCallback Hook, it doesn't create multiple instance of same function
when re-render happens.

Instead of creating new instance of the function, it provides the cached function on re-render of the componenet.
