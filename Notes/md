What is Hooks?
Ans- Hooks are special functions, that allow us to use state and other React features in functional components.

Earlier, When we used to create react app using functional component, then we didn't have access to the state management and lifecycle methods

To access these features we had to add class components.

So this was the problem with functional component.

But after introducing React Hooks from version 16.8, we can now use state managemnet and other react features
without writing class components.

in other words, Hooks are the functions the make functional components work like class components.

Hooks made react functional components so easy to use
Developer prefer functional components over class components
