useMemo Hook - The React useMemo Hook returns a memoized value. (it's like caching a value so that it doesn't
need to be recalculated)

The useMemo Hook only runs when one of its dependencies gets updated.

performance, that is useCallback hook.

The useMemo and useCallback Hooks are similar. the main difference is:
-useMemo return a memoized value.
-useCallback return  a memoized value function.
